# Detection-Driven Threat Hunting Mini Platform

## Objective
This project focuses on hypothesis-driven threat hunting and detection logic development using log-derived signals.
The project emphasizes correlation-based detections,
where multiple weak signals are combined to produce
high-confidence alerts.


## Initial Use Case
Credential Access – Password Spraying (MITRE ATT&CK T1110)

## Why This Project Exists
To practice how SOC analysts and detection engineers think:
from raw logs → hypothesis → detection logic → alert reasoning.

## Detection Philosophy

This project focuses on correlation-based detections rather than
single-event alerts. Each detection is designed to combine multiple
weak signals into high-confidence outcomes, mimicking real SOC
decision-making.
